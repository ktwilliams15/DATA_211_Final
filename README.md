# Final Project
### Background
For the final project, I started by analyzing child abuse statistics in the United States. My goal was to understand if low income and/or unemployment acts as a driver of child abuse. The original data contained the number of child abuse cases per state in 2018. As expected, the states with larger populations had more child abuse cases. Importing U.S. census data, I was able to find the number of children (under the age of 18) in each state. To standardize the data, I divided the total child abuse cases in each state by the number of children in each state. In order to grow understanding of child abuse, I decided to compare the percentage of child abuse to median yearly income, unemployment rates, and the child fatality (due to abuse) rate in each state. Looking at a heatmap of the correlations of these features, you can see that this data does not inherently contain strong correlations.

### Findings
Although the heat map does not show strong correlations, there were some interesting findings in the data. When comparing the ten states with the lowest median incomes, to the states with the highest unemployment rates, the highest child fatality rates, and the highest child abuse percentages, the results could reflect key information. Interestingly, the states with the highest fatality rates and the states with the highest percentage of child abuse only had two states overlap. This may be interesting to look at further from a psychological perspective. Perhaps child abuse perpetrators want to avoid law enforcement engagements. The large disparity in power gives them confidence that the victim will remain silent and as long as the abuse does not escalate, the perpetrators can continue their habits of abuse without being discovered. In fact, the perpetrators may be especially careful to take care of their victims as to maintain the Perpetrator-Victim relationship. [In this map,](https://ktwilliams15.github.io/abuse_perc/abuse_fatal.html) focusing on Kentucky, we notice an inverse relationship between child fatality rates and child abuse percentages. Although Kentucky has the highest percentage of child abuse (2.35%), it has the fifth lowest Child Fatality Rates (.59). Similarly, Montana has the ninth highest child abuse percentage (1.65%) but the tenth lowest child fatality rate (.87). And again in Rhode Island, the child abuse percentage is the fourth worst (1.77%) but the child fatality rate is the fourth lowest (.87).

The states with the ten lowest median incomes and the ten highest unemployment ratios had four overlaps. Economically, it makes sense that a state with a higher unemployment ratio will have lower wages. Since the supply of workers is larger than the number of jobs, companies can pay workers less money because there are unemployed citizens willing to work for lower wages. Conversely, it could be that since the wages offered by companies in that state are lower, unemployed citizens do not feel that they are being compensated fairly and choose to collect unemployment rather than work. Although, this is not a likely scenario since you must be actively looking for a job to be considered part of the work force and thus contributing to the unemployment rate. [Using this map,](https://ktwilliams15.github.io/unemp_rate/unemp_inc.html) you can clearly identify the negative relationship between median income and unemployment rates. New Mexico has the highest unemployment rate (7.53%) and the fourth lowest median income ($41,197). South Carolina has the eighth highest unemployment rate (6.05%) and the seventh lowest median income ($42,126). Louisiana and West Virginia yield similar results.

When using Income and Unemployment Rates as predictors of the Child Fatality Rate and Percentage of Child Abuse Victims, there is considerable overlap. Five states in the ten lowest median incomes are also among the top ten states with the highest Child Fatality Rates. Further, four of the ten states with the lowest median incomes are among the top ten states with the highest Percentage of Child Abuse. The unemployment ratio was not as strong of a predictor as the median income; however, two states of the ten highest unemployment ratios were in the top ten states with the highest Child Fatality Rate, and three states among the highest unemployment ratios were also among the states with the highest child abuse percentages. Comparing the ten states with the highest median incomes, to the states with the ten lowest unemployment rates, the ten lowest child fatality rates, and the ten lowest child abuse percentages yielded similar results (although not as strong) to the converse analyzed above. There were three states that overlapped in the percentage of child abuse and child fatality rate. Only two states of the ten with the highest median income were also in the top ten of states with the lowest unemployment rates. Two states among the ten with the highest median income were also in the top ten states with the lowest child abuse percentages. Two different states in the group of ten states with the lowest unemployment rates were also in the group of ten states with the lowest child abuse percentages. Four states with the lowest child fatality rates overlapped with the states with the highest median income. Two of the overlaps, New Hampshire and Nebraska, are also among the top ten states with the lowest unemployment rates. In total, four of the ten states with the lowest child fatality rates were also among the ten states with the lowest unemployment rates. 

[This map](https://ktwilliams15.github.io/abuse_perc/per_inc.html) highlights the negative relationship between child abuse percentages and median income. Particularly noticeable are Kentucky, where the abuse percentage is the highest in the country at 2.35% and the median income is fifth lowest at $41,470; West Virginia where abuse is second highest (1.91%) and median income is sixth lowest ($41,701); and New Mexico (eighth highest child abuse percentage and fourth lowest median income) as well as South Carolina (sixth highest in child abuse percentage and seventh lowest median income). Further, in the opposite direction, New Jersey has the second highest median income $77,047 and the fourth lowest child abuse percentage (.31%). Hawaii has the seventh highest median income and the eighth lowest percent of child abuse. 

Not as informative as the above map, [this map](https://ktwilliams15.github.io/abuse_perc/per_un.html) shows almost no relationship between child abuse percentages and unemployment rates. Attempting to correlate high unemployment rates with high child abuse percentages may be supported by New Mexico (highest rate of unemployment and the eighth highest child abuse percentage), South Carolina (eighth highest unemployment rate and sixth highest child abuse percentage), and West Virginia (tenth highest unemployment rate and second highest child abuse percentage). However, Montana has the lowest unemployment rate but the ninth highest percentage of child abuse. Also, Indiana and Kentucky have low unemployment rates but high child abuse percentages. Conversely, New Jersey has the fourth lowest percentage of child abuse and the thirteenth highest unemployment ratio.



Again, 
[this map](https://ktwilliams15.github.io/abuse_perc/fat_inc.html) illustrates in southern states that a low median income leads to higher child fatality rates. Arkansas has the second lowest median income ($39,025) and the highest child fatality rate (6.26). Mississippi has the lowest median income ($37,018) and the fifth highest child fatality rate (4.25). South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and New Mexico have similar results. Conversely, looking at New England, the high median income states have much lower child fatality rates. New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island are among the highest in median income (second, third, and fourth, respectively) while also being among the lowest in child fatality rates (twelfth, fifteenth, and fourth, respectively). 


Child fatality rates may have a slight positive correlation with the unemployment rate. [This map shows](https://ktwilliams15.github.io/abuse_perc/fat_un.html) that Montana has the lowest unemployment rate and the tenth lowest child fatality rate. Nebraska has the sixth lowest unemployment rate and the lowest child fatality rate. New Hampshire has the ninth lowest unemployment rate and the second lowest child fatality rate. Conversely, D.C. has the fifth highest unemployment rate (6.6%) and the eighth highest child fatality rate (3.92). South Carolina has an unemployment rate of 6.05%, putting it at the eighth highest in the country and the ninth highest child fatality rate at 3.53. However, North Dakota and Wyoming show a negative correlation between child fatality rates and unemployment rates. North Dakota has an unemployment rate that is fifth lowest in the country, but a child fatality rate that is fourth highest in the country. Also, Wyoming ranks fourth among states with the highest unemployment rate yet it has the eighth lowest child fatality rate.  

This link will allow you to compare all four variables at one time. Be warned: this map is very difficult to analyze.

### Conclusions
Claiming that this research supports a relationship between child abuse and income or more generally employment prospects (unemployment rates) is inaccurate. With that being said, the final results yielded very interesting starting points for future research. Using a more advanced machine learning model, one could begin to find the strongest indicators to child abuse. Adding in a few more features such as average education level, race, and criminal records from each state could potentially create a strong machine learning model that identifies the states most at risk of high child abuse percentages. Perhaps it would be best to mathematically combine the Child Fatality Rate and Percentage of Child Abuse into a single category, acting as the target. The original data did contain a value associated to the degree of child abuse. Thus, our model could not only indentify high percentages but also degrees of violence. Further, obtaining data at the county level is essential to continued research. Even among states, the variance from county to county is to large to make any sweeping claims about why there is high rates of child abuse. At the county level, the results begin to lead to greater understanding of the drivers of child absue.
