# DATA 211 Final
#### Background
For the final project, I started by analyzing child abuse statistics in the United States. The original data contained the number of child abuse cases per state in 2018. As expected, the states with larger populations had more child abuse cases. Importing U.S. census data, I was able to find the number of children (under the age of 18) in each state. To standardize the data, I divided the total child abuse cases in each state by the number of children in each state. In order to grow understanding of child abuse, I decided to compare the percentage of child abuse to median income, unemployment rates, and the child fatality rate in each state. Looking at a heatmap of the correlations of these features, you can quickly see that there is not a strong relationship between any of these features.
